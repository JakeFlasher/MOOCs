If variable is categorical, determine if it is ordinal based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering. Counted data are discrete numerical variables since they can't take on non-whole values.*"

To do so, she asks each person in her statistics class for the size of their household, and reports that her sample is a simple random sample. However, this is not a simple random sample. Which of the following is the best reasoning for why this is not a random sample that is appropriate for this research question?  \n",
