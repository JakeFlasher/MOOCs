    "### Evaluating the relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating the relationship between two numerical variables, we should make sure to examine the direction of the relationship. Is it increasing, or decreasing. The shape of the relationship, i.e., is it linear, or does it follow some other form? The strength of the relationship. Is the relationship strong? Indicated by little scatter. Or weak, indicated by lots of scatter. And any potential outliers.  These can be individual observations or a group of observations. It's always a good idea to investigate these points carefully to make sure they're not data entry errors. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "In a histogram, data are binned into intervals and height of the bars represent the number of cases that fall into each interval. It provides a view of the data density and it is especially useful for describing the shape of the distribution. For example, in this case the distribution of life expectancies appear to be left skewed which is expected due to the leveling off of life expectancies. There's a physiological limit to how long people live. And in most countries, people live up to that time but there are some countries with much lower life expectancies and fewer and fewer of these countries with lower and lower expectancies. Resulting in a long left tail. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is the distribution of income, which is right skewed. Incomes can't be negative so we have a natural boundary at zero, but there is no real upper limit to how high incomes can go. However, as we go higher and higher we have fewer and fewer countries with such high levels of personal income resulting in a long right tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skewness\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributions are set to be skewed to the left side of the long tail. In a left skewed distribution, the longer tail is on the left on the negative end. If no skewness is apparent, then the distribution is said to be symmetric. And in a right skewed distribution, the longer tail is on the right, the positive end. As you can see, the best way to assess the shape of distributions is to step back and imagine a smooth curve outlining the distribution, instead of focusing on the jagged edges of the bars in the histogram. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/skewness.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modality\n",
    "\n",
    "A distribution might be unimodal with one prominent peak, bimodal with two prominent peaks, or uniform with no prominent peaks. With more than two prominent peaks a distribution is usually said to be multimodal. The distribution that you will most closely work with is unimodal, the normal distribution, that you may also know as the bell curve. A bimodal distribution might indicate that there are two distinct groups in your data. A uniformed distribution means there's no apparent trend in the data. That high and low values of the variable are equally likely to occur. \n",

    "### Visualization using Box plot\n",
    "\n",
    "A box plot also readily displace the median. The mid point of the distribution, this is the thick line inside the box, and the interquartile range, the width of the box. Outliers are represented with circles in this visualization. \n",
