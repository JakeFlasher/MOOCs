    "*The American Community Survey is an ongoing survey that provides data every year to give communities the current information they need to plan investments and services. The 2010 American community survey estimates that 14.6% of Americans live below the poverty line. 20.7% speak a language other than English at home, and 4.2% fall into both categories. Based on this information, what percent of Americans live below the poverty line given that they speak a language other than English at home?*\n",

We're the comparing the 14.6% for the general public to the 20% that we arrived at, for the part of the public that speaks a language other than English at home.

    "\n",
    "If I wanted to find the overall probability of social science majors in this class, that would be 60 out of 100, so the probability that a randomly-selected student is a social science major is 0.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(SS) = \\frac{60}{100} = 0.6$<br>\n",

    "What about the males? 50 males in the class, 30 of which are social science majors. So once again, probability of social science given male is 30 out of 50, 60% as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(SS\\ |\\ M) = \\frac{30}{50} = 0.6$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we're seeing here is that all of these probabilities are exactly the same. So this goes back to `P(A | B)`. If that equals `P(A)`, then we know that the events are independent. In this case, `P(SS) = P(SS | F)` or `P(SS) = P(SS | M)`. So we would determine that the two variables, gender and major are independent of each other, given this hypothetical distribution. "
