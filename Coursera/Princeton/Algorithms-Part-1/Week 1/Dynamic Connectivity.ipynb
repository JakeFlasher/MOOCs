    "## The UNION FIND Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem there is a set of $N$ objects and connections between objects. We postulate that there is an `union` command that connects two objects. Thus, given two objects, it provides a connection between them as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "union(1, 3)\n",
    "> {1,3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another command is the `connected` query, which verifies if there is a path connecting the two objects, as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "connected(1, 3)\n",
    "> True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the image below, we have a set of ten objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/dynamic_connectivity.svg\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "These objects were connected using the following sequence of commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "union(4, 3)\n",
    "union(3, 8)\n",
    "union(6, 5)\n",
    "union(9, 4)\n",
    "union(2, 1)\n",
    "union(5, 0)\n",
    "union(7, 2)\n",
    "union(6, 1)\n",
    "union(1, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can ask for connection between two objects as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "connected(1, 8)\n",
    "> False\n",
    "\n",
    "connected(8, 9)\n",
    "> True\n",
    "\n",
    "connected(0, 7)\n",
    "> True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we ask for the connection between eight and nine, the system answer `True` since there is a path from eight to three to four to nine (8 $\\rightarrow$ 3 $\\rightarrow$ 4 $\\rightarrow$ 9). Understood this, we need a few abstract properties that these connections have to satisfy. We assume that *is connected to* is an equivalence relation, *i.e.*, every object is connected to itself. It is *symmetric* if $P$ is connected to $Q$, then $Q$ is connected to $P$. It is transitive if $P$ is connected to $Q$, and $Q$ is connected to $R$, then $P$ is connected to $R$. Thus, a connected component is a maximal set of objects that is mutually connected. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in this small example below we have three connected components. One consisting of just object zero, second one with objects one, four and five; and the third one with the other four objects. \n",

So, for this example, we have a client that reads information from standard input. First, an integer which is the number of objects that are going to be processed. Then, a series of pairs of object names. What the client does first is to read the integer from standard input, and create a UF object. Then, as long as standard input is not empty, it is going to read two integers from the input. If they are not connected, then it connects them and print them out. If they are connected it ignores. That's our test client and that's a fine test client to make sure that any implementation does what we expect that it will. \n",

Thus, each entry in the array has associated with it a root. Elements that are connected to their own component and point to themselves are roots.

As the roots are the same ids, we just set the value of the `index=4` to zero, indicating that the root of four is zero. Next, we apply `union(0, 7)`, indicating that the root of the tree containing zero is seven. Thus, we set the value of `index=0` to seven. In `union(9, 4)`, we see that the root of four is seven. Thus, we have to set the value of `index=9` as the root seven. In case of create a union of two components that have the same root, we keep the tree unchanged.

    "Weighted quick-union is a very effective improvement on quick-union. The idea is to process as quick-union but taking some steps to avoid having tall trees. Thus, if you have a large tree and a small tree to combine together, you should avoid putting the smaller tree under the larger, which would lead to long tall trees. In order to avoid large trees, we keep track of the number of objects in each tree and maintain balance by always making sure that we link the root of the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree. The image below illustrates an example of this algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/weighted_quickunion.svg\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this algorithm, when there is only two items to link, it works the same way as quick-union no matter which order their arguments came since both have the smaller tree. Thus, when performing `union(4, 0)` we can put any of them as root. Here we add zero as root of four. Next, when performing `union(0, 7)` we have to add the element to keep the smallest tree. Thus, unlike quick-union where we add zero to the root seven, in weighted quick-union we add seven to the root zero, keeping a tree with two nodes deep instead of tree nodes deep. When applying `union(9, 4)`, we add nine to the root of four as it would occur in quick-union. This process continues up to the last node being added. \n",

    "Below we have a comparison of two trees created with Quick-Union and Weighted Quick-Union algorithms. In this image, we can see the difference in depth between both trees.\n",

    "\n",
    "This example illustrates a hundred elements and 88 union operations. We can see in the top tree that some nodes contain a fair distance from the root. In the bottom tree, all the nodes are within distance four from the root and the average distance to the root is much, much lower."

While we are doing that, we might as well make each one of those just point to the root. We can easlily do this by making every other node in the path point to its grandparent on the way up the tree. In the image below we can see on the left side a complete tree in which we are going to apply `union(6, 3)`. Thus, we are going to add the tree containing 6 to the tree containing 3. We discover that the root of the tree is zero, then, we add the tree of root six to the root zero. In the path to discover the root, we also have the nodes `3` and  `1`. Thus, we set the root of `3` as the root of the tree and keep the root of `1` as `0` since it is the root of the tree.\n",

A system is percolated if the top and the bottom are connected by open sites. For example, on the left side of the image below, one can find a way to get from the top to the bottom through white squares, but the system on the right does not percolate since there is no way to get from the top to the bottom through white squares. \n",

There's not enough open sites to have a connection from the top to the bottom. If the probability is high and there is a lot of open sides, it definitely is going to percolate, and there would be lots of ways to get from the top to the bottom. On the other hand, when the probability is close to the half, it's questionable whether it percolates or not. In fact, there is a value as $N$ gets large that if you have less than that value it almost certainly that it will not percolate and if you have greater than the value it almost certainly will. \n",

Every time we add an open site, we check to see if it makes the system percolate. We keep going until we get to a point where the system percolates, showing that the vacancy percentage at the time that it percolates is an estimate of this threshold value. We can run this experiment millions of times to verify the threshold value. \n",

For each site on the top, we would have to check each site on the bottom, what would become too slow for large values of $N$. To open a new site, we just connect it to all its adjacent open sites (as illustred on the right in the image above).
