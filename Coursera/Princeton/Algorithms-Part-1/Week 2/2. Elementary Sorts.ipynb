    "Therefore, our goal is to sort any type of data. When developing the method to sort, we have to implement in the so called a **total order**, which consists of three properties: *Antisymmetry*, *Transitivity* and *Totality*. *Antisymmetry* says that if $v \\le w$ and $w \\le v$, then the only way to that to be true is that $v = w$. *Transitivity* says that if $v \\le w$ and $w \\le x$, then $v \\le x$. Finally, *Totality* says that either $v \\le w$ or $w \\le v$ or both are equal. Summarizing:\n",

    "- **Totality**: either $v \\le w$ or $w \\le v$ or both.\n",

    "We have to pay attention since not all orders are necessarily total orders. For example, the game *Rock-Paper-Scissors* is not total order since *Rock* blunts *Scissor*, *Scissor* cuts *Paper*, and *Paper* wrap *Rock*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To devolop a comparable API, we implement `compare_to()` method as a total order. Considering two values $v$ and $w$, the method must return a negative integer if $v$ is less than $w$, zero if $v$ is equal to $w$ or a positive integer if $v$ is greater than $w$. An implementation of the *Comparable* API is shown below:"

    "Insertion sort is another elementary method that interestingly has quite different performance characteristics than Selection sort. For insertion sort, we will move an index $i$ from left to right and in the $i$'th iteration, we are going to move $vec[i]$ into position among the elements to its left. We consider that everything from $i$ to its left is sorted (in ascending order) and everything from its right is unseen. Then, we increment $i$, seen a new element (which is unordered). We use another index ($j$) that starts at $i$ going to the left. This index $j$ swaps the current element ($vec[i]$ with its higher element at the left $vec[j]$ when $vec[i]$ is less than $vec[j]$. It stops swapping when $vec[j]$ is smaller than $vec[i]$. We then increase $i$, showing a new element. This process goes up to the end of the array. The image below illustrates the insertion sort algorithm using cards.\n",

    "The idea of Shellsort is that Insertion Sort is inefficient because elements really move **only one** position at the time even when they have a long way to go. The idea behind Shellsort is that entries move several positions at a time. To do this, we use the so called $h$-sorting the array. So, an $h$-sorted array is $h$ different sorted sub-sequences. For example, a case with $h=4$, we look at every four elements in the array. Then, these elements are sorted. Next, we decrease the value of $h$ and sort again the selected values. The value of $h$ descreases again and it repeats up to the 1-sort. To perform sub-sequences, we can use the Insertion sort algorithm. Below, we have an example of sorting an array using an increment of $h=8$, $h=4$, $h=2$, and $h=1$. Thus, inicially, we sort only few values. As we increase the number of elements, the algorithm gives small steps performing small swaps.\n",

We start with the array in order (actually it does not matter how the array starts) and every time we pick an integer between zero and $i-1$ uniformly at random, we swap it wiht the value in $i$. Let's consider the example below. For the first element ($i=0$) we do not do anything. We increment $i$ and swap the value of $vec[i]$ by the value of $vec[0]$. Next, we increment $i$ again. Now, we randomly select a number between $0$ and $i-1$. We swap the value of $vec[i]$ by the value of $vec[r]$ where $r$ is the index corresponding to the random number. We keep doing it up to the end of the array. Important to note that in the image below we denote `random=<value>` with the value being the number corresponding to the card instead of the index of the array.

    "An application of find the convex hull can be in the case where you have a robot that wants to get from $s$ to $t$ and there is an obstacle that is defined by some polygon. You wanted be able to go around the obstacle and it turns out that the shortest path, either it is a straight line from $s$ to $t$ or it is part of the convex hull. Or if you want to find the pair of points that are the farthest apart in the set of points in the plane (this is sometimes important in statistical calculation or other applications). If you have the convex hull, this computation is easy, since they are going to be the extreme points on the convex hull. \n",

    "- Fact 1: That you can traverse the convex hull by making only counter clockwise turns, *i.e.*, left turns. \n",
    "- Fact 2: The vertices of convex hull appear in increasing order of polar angle with respect to point $p$ with lowest y-coordinate, *i.e.*, if you take the point with the lowest $y$ coordinate and look at the polar angle of every other point with the respect to that one, then the vertices appear in increasing order of that angle.\n",

    "The algorithm that we are going to develop is called the Graham scan and it is based on those two facts. The idea is to start with point $p$, the one with the smallest $y$ coordinate. Sort the points by polar angle from $p$, *i.e*, if we take a vertical line in $p$ and sweep it in a counterclockwise direction, the next point is the one that we hit. We access point by point, throwing away the ones that do not create a counterclockwise turn. Consider the example illustred in the image below, at the beginning (a), we have a line that connects $p$ to 1. From that point, in (b) we turn counterclockwise and achieve the point 2. In (c), we turn counterclockwise and achieve the point 3. Next, in (d), we can not turn counterclockwise and achieve the point 4. Thus, we eliminate the point 3 of our convex hull and connect the point 2 directly to the point 4. In (e), we can not turn counterclockwise and achieve the point 5. Thus, we go back to the point 2 and try to turn counterclockwise and achieve the point 5. We still can not achieve it. So, we return to point 1 and tur counterclockwise to achieve the point 5. As we can achieve it, we now have two lines in our convex hull ($p \\rightarrow 1$, $1 \\rightarrow 5$). We keep doing this up to return to the point $p$.\n",
