## [FutureLearn Robotic Vision: Principles of Vision](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/robotic-vision-principles/)
Programming a robot to see requires understanding the principles of vision, and having mathematical knowledge and programming skills. We start by considering the question, â€˜What is vision?â€™ Youâ€™ll learn about human vision and aspects of sight, including light, reflection, perspective and how cameras work. Robot vision relies on these same principles but uses cameras and computers instead of eyes and a brain.

## [FutureLearn Introducing Robotics: Making Robots Move](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/making-robots-move)
Making robots move requires both mathematical knowledge and programming skills. We begin with the problem of describing where things are in the world. Starting simply, we consider objects in a two-dimensional plane, exploring the concepts of position, pose, rotation, and translation. Robot movement relies on the principles of kinematics â€“ the motion of a body or bodies. You'll program forward kinematics equations in MATLAB and learn approaches to inverse kinematics. We examine types of motion in 2D, and dive into some principles of joint control theory. We finish with a taste of 3D robotics!
