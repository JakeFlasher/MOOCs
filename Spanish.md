## [FutureLearn Teaching Physical Computing with Raspberry Pi and Python](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/physical-computing-raspberry-pi-python)
Create simple systems that respond to and control the physical world using the Raspberry Pi and Python.

## [FutureLearn Object-oriented Programming in Python](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/object-oriented-principles)
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on objects and data rather than actions and logic. This online course will introduce you to the principles of object-oriented programming in Python, showing you how to create objects, functions, methods, and classes. You'll use what you learn to create your own text-based adventure game, and you will have the chance to share your code with other learners and see theirs. If you're an educator, you'll also be able to develop ideas for using object-oriented programming in your classroom.

## [FutureLearn Teaching Physical Computing with Raspberry Pi and Python](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/physical-computing-raspberry-pi-python)
Over four weeks, you'll develop your knowledge of simple electronics and computing, setting up your Raspberry Pi and writing your first program using the Python programming language. You'll apply your newfound knowledge to a series of challenges, including controlling an LED with Python, using a button press to control a circuit, and making a button and LED game. If you're a teacher, you'll also have the chance to develop ideas for using the Raspberry Pi and Python in your classroom, and to connect with a network of other educators.
