# Udacity : Deep Learning

This folder contains codes to the [Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) course by Vincent Vanhoucke from Google Brain. 

According to the description presented in the web site:

> Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there, and deep learning represents its true bleeding edge. In this course, you’ll develop a clear understanding of the motivation for deep learning, and design intelligent systems that learn from complex and/or large-scale datasets.
> 
> We’ll show you how to train and optimize basic neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and long short term memory networks. Complete learning systems in TensorFlow will be introduced via projects and assignments. You will learn to solve new classes of problems that were once thought prohibitively challenging, and come to better appreciate the complex nature of human intelligence as you solve these same problems effortlessly using deep learning methods.
> 
> We have developed this course with Vincent Vanhoucke, Principal Scientist at Google, and technical lead in the Google Brain team.
