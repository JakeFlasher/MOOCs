    "The key question: what risks do I need to consider on this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project risk will vary as a result of:\n",
    " - the extent and duration of your project\n",
    " - the period of time between the planning and execution phases\n",
    " - the level of experience you and your team members have by undertaking similar projects\n",
    " - the maturity of the technology being used\n",
    " \n",
    "## Types of risks:\n",
    " - technical risk\n",
    " - financial risk (risks in the form of budget overspend)\n",
    " - schedule risk (being late on deliveries)\n",
    " - commercial risk\n",
    " - reputational risk (risk to the brand or reputation)\n",
    " \n",
    "## How could I treat those risks?\n",
    " - simply ignoring them\n",
    " - making a judgement of the probability of occurrence\n",

    "\n",
    "## So what is the best approach to use to plan a major risk in your project?\n",
    " 1. understand the context of your project and to confirm your project objectives\n",
    " 2. risk identification which may impact on achieving your project objectives (stakeholders together)\n",
    " 3. undertake a risk assessment\n",
    "   - prioritise by assessing their severity using a combination of both likelihood and the impact that each risk may have on your objectives\n",
    "   <img src=\"imgs/risk_matrix.jpg\" width=\"70%\"/>\n",
    " 4. consider and plan risk responses (can be responded to in four ways)\n",
    "    - risk can be accepted\n",
    "    - risk can be transferred to another party\n",
    "    - risk can be mitigated or reduced\n",
    "    - risk can be avoided\n",
    " 5. monitor and review risks (ongoing process not a once off tick-the-box activity)\n",
    " 6. communicate the outcomes to the relevant stakeholders to assist their decision making\n",
    " \n",
    "Put a strategy in place for each risk by deciding whether you are prepared to accept the risk, transfer the risk, reduce the risk, or avoid the risk entirely."
