According to the description presented in the web site:

> Arduino uno is a small computer used to connect the physical world to the digital world. Introduced in the early 2000s as a tool for design students who had no experience in electronics programming, it has become the most popular electronics prototyping tool, especially for IoT product development, a sector which companies are estimated to spend more than $300 billion a year on by 2020. With several million users and counting, Arduino gives anyone the power to innovate - from designing a connected object for their own home to launching a prototype of a product for their own business.
> 
> This course is ideal for students in design or electronics. It's also highly applicable for engineers, designers, or developers who want to strengthen their skills in interactive electronics. It suits those who are either completely new to Arduino or want to practice their skills with concrete coding challenges. You will learn about electronics and programming, starting from the very basics and building up to mastery of the Arduino platform. You will learn how to use sensors to detect external events, such as light or sound, and how to perform an action linked to these events.
> 
> The course also provides a natural introduction to the world of FabLabs, an international network of over a thousand spaces where people can access digital manufacturing machines and practice using Arduino alongside other makers. The course also provides recommendations of where learners can easily purchase an arduino starter kit to get the right hardware to set themselves up or online simulators which work well as alternatives if they aren't quite ready to invest in the material yet. Want to get creative? You'll see that everyone can become a maker! Join us!


## What you'll learn
- How to program an Arduino microcontroller
- Ways to interface Arduino with analog and digital sensors (detecting things like light, noise, or pressure)
- How to use a software library to control motors, lights, sounds, and more
- Application of key concepts for prototyping from Fablabs (learning by example, rapid prototyping)
