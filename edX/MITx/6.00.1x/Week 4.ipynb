      "# Dealing\n",
      "# A player is dealt a hand of n letters chosen at random (assume n=7 for now).\n",
      "#\n",

      "# Some letters may remain unused (these won't be scored).\n",
      "#\n",
      "# Scoring\n",
      "# The score for the hand is the sum of the scores for each word formed.\n",
      "# The score for a word is the sum of the points for letters in the word, multiplied by the length of the word, plus 50 points \n",
      "# if all n letters are used on the first word created.\n",
      "# Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on. \n",
      "# We have defined the dictionary SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES that maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.\n",
      "#\n",
      "# For example, 'weed' would be worth 32 points ((4+1+1+2) for the four letters, then multiply by len('weed') \n",

      "#\n",
      "# As another example, if n=7 and you make the word 'waybill' on the first try, it would be worth 155 points \n",
