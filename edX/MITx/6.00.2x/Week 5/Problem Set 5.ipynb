    "## BACKGROUND\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph consists of a set of nodes, also known as vertices, (n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, n<sub>3</sub>, ....) and a set of edges (e<sub>1</sub>, e<sub>2</sub>, e<sub>3</sub>, ...) where an edge connects two nodes that are in the graph. The node n<sub>1</sub> has children nodes if there exists an edge from n<sub>1</sub> to each child node. In Figure 1, Node \"a\" has children nodes \"b\" and \"c\".\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of edges: directed and undirected. If the edge is directed, then the edge has a specific direction going from start to destination node. Graphs with directed edges are called directed graphs (or digraph).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='ProblemSet5/directedgraph.gif', width='25%'/>\n",
    "Figure 1. Example of a directed graph where each edge has a specific direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the edge is undirected, also known as bidirectional, then it no longer matters which node is the start or destination node because you can traverse the edge from one node to the other in either direction. Essentially, a link in the graph can be represented by a directed edge going from Node \"d\" to Node \"e\" and a directed edge going in the reverse direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='ProblemSet5/undirectedgraph.gif', width='25%'/>\n",
    "Figure 2. Example of an undirected graph where each edge is bidirectional.\n",
    "\n",
    "An edge can also have a weight. If every edge is associated with a real number (edge weight), then we have weighted graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='ProblemSet5/weightedgraph.gif', width='25%'/>\n",
    "Figure 3. Example of an weighted graph where each edge has a weight associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a graph theory problem, the objective function is the function to be minimized (or maximized). For example, choosing the shortest path for airplane flights is an optimization problem where the objective function is to minimize the distance traveled. The nodes are the destination airports and edges are the presence of airplane routes between airports. We can add additional constraints on the problem that must be satisfied such as requiring that the plane only make at most 2 stops along the way from start to end destination. Then the shortest path is only valid if it satisfies the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## THE MIT MAP\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='ProblemSet5/campusmap.gif', width='25%'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the map of the MIT campus. From the text input file, mit_map.txt, you will build a representation of this map in Python using the graph-related data structures that we provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line in mit_map.txt has 4 pieces of data in it in the following order separated by a single space (space-delimited): the start building, the destination building, the distance in meters between the two buildings, and the distance in meters between the two buildings that must be spent outdoors. For example, suppose the map text file contained the following line:\n",
    "\n",
    "10     32     200     40\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the map contains an edge from building 10 (start location) to building 32 (end location) that is 200 meters long, where 40 of those 200 meters are spent outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the problem interesting, we will say that not every route between a pair of buildings is bi-directional. For example, it may be possible to get from building 54 (Green building) to building 56, but not the other way around, because the wind that blows away from the Green building is too strong."

    "## Problem 1 - Creating the Data Structure Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "(20 points possible)<br>\n",
    "In this problem set, we are dealing with edges that have different weights. In the figure below, the blue numbers with a bar above them show the cost of traversing an edge in terms of total distance traveled, while the green numbers show the cost of traversing an edge in terms of distance spent outdoors. Note that the distance spent outdoors for a single edge is always less than or equal to the total distance it takes to traverse that edge. Now the cost of going from \"a\" to \"b\" to \"e\" is a total distance traveled of 22 meters, where 14 of those meters are spent outdoors. These weights are important when comparing multiple paths because you want to look at the weights associated with the edges in the path instead of just the number of edges traversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='ProblemSet5/weightedWithContraint.png', width='25%'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In ```graph.py```, youâ€™ll find the ```Digraph```, ```Node```, and ```Edge``` classes, which do not store information about weights associated with each edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extend the classes so that it fits our case of a weighted graph. Think about how you can modify the classes to store the weights shown above. Make modifications directly in graph.py. We highly recommend that you read through the entire problem set before settling on a particular implementation and representation of nodes and edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hint: Creating subclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclass the provided classes to add your own functionality to the new classes. Deciding what representation to use in order to build up the graph is the most challenging part of the problem set, so think through the problem carefully. As a start, ```WeightedEdge``` should be a subclass of ```Edge```, and ```WeightedGraph``` should be a subclass of ```Digraph```. \n",
    "\n",
    "Define a ```WeightedDigraph``` class to represent your graph. You will also need to define a ```WeightedEdge``` class to represent the edges of your graph. Be sure to use subclassing and inheritance. With your ```WeightedDigraph``` implementation, you should be able to replicate the transcript, which begins to model the graph."

    "\n",
    "(20 points possible)<br>\n",
    "Since enumerating all the paths is inefficient, letâ€™s optimize our search algorithm for the shortest path. As you discover new children nodes in your depth-first search, you can keep track of the shortest path that so far that minimizes the distance traveled and minimizes the distance outdoors to fit the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you come across a path that is longer than your shortest path found so far, then you know that this longer path cannot be your solution, so there is no point in continuing to traverse its children and discover all paths that contain this sub-path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the function `directedDFS(digraph, start, end, maxTotalDist, maxDistOutdoor)` that uses this optimized method to find the shortest overall path in a directed graph from start node to end node under the following constraints: the total distance travelled is less than or equal to `maxTotalDist`, and the total distance spent outdoors is less than or equal to `maxDistOutdoor`. If multiple paths are still found, then return any one of them. If no path can be found to satisfy these constraints, then raise a `ValueError` exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the previous problem, we suggest using one or more helper functions to implement `directedDFS` (see hint from above). In particular, is there any additional information you can pass or variable you can update that can help you reduce the number of nodes traversed?\n",
