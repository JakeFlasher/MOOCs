    "`cityTemps.txt` - a text file containing information about varous cities in the United States. The first few lines starting with the hash (#) represent the column titles of the data available. The lines without the hash represent the actual data, separated by a comma -- in this case, cities and their average temperature in Jan, average temperature in April, average temperature in July, average temperature in October, annual precipitation in inches, and the number of days of precipitation in a year.\n",

    "`clusterCities.py` - a file containing some useful classes and a partial implementation of the Cluster and ClusterSet classes. In particular, this file contains:\n",
    "* A function, `scaleFeatures`, that can be used to scale the dataset features. Scaling essentially normalizes the values to be between 0 and 1 so that certain features do not overwhelm others\n",

    "* Classes `Point` and `City`\n",
    "* An incomplete implementation of class `Cluster`. You will implement the functions `singleLinkageDist`, `maxLinkageDist`, `averageLinkageDist`.\n",
