KEY POINTS

An Azure ML experiment is usually published as a Web service, to which real-time data can be passed as input and results are returned as output. In addition to the real-time data passed to the web service, the experiment may reference static data.

Real-time data is passed to a published experiment through the Web Service Input module. Results are passed to the client that called the experiment web service through the Web Service Output module.

You can use the following Azure ML modules to read and write static data:

- Dataset (read data from sample data or manually uploaded data files)
- Enter Data (enter data values directly into the experiment)
- Reader (read data from Azure storage, Azure SQL Database, HTTP URLs, data feeds, or Hive queries)
- Writer (write data to Azure storage, Azure SQL Database, or HTTP URLs)

You can use the Join module to combine two datasets based on common key fields.
You can use the Add Rows module to concatenate (or union) two datasets with similar schema.

Joins: Both tables need common key column X_join(A, B, keyColumn)

- Inner join: rows with at least one key match in A and B
- Left join: all rows from the left table with all matching rows of the right table
- right join: all rows from the right table with all matching rows of the left table
- Full join: retains all values all all rows
