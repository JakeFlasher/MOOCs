KEY POINTS

The process for creating classification models is similar to that for regression models.

As with regression models, you can use the Evaluate Model module to determine model performance, you can use the Sweep Parameters module to train a classification module based on a random selection of parameter settings, and you can use the Cross Validate module to ensure that the function and coefficients in the model are generalizable.

The metrics for evaluating classification model performance are based on statistics for true positive (TP), true negative (TF), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) predictions. These metrics include:

            +------------+-------------+
            | Model True | Model False |
+-----------+------------+-------------|
|Real True  |     TP     |     TN      |
|-----------+------------+-------------|
|Real False |     FP     |     FN      |
+-----------+------------+-------------+

Accuracy = TP + TN / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Precision (or positive predictive value) = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
F1 = Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)
