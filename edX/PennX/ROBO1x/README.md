According to the description presented in the web site:

> How do you create robots that operate well in the real world? Learn the key math concepts and tools used to design robots that excel in navigating our complex, unstructured world in environments such as aerospace, automotive, manufacturing and healthcare.
> 
> In this course, part of the Robotics MicroMasters program, you will learn how to apply concepts from linear algebra, geometry and group theory and the tools to configure and control the motion of manipulators and mobile robots.
> 
> You will also learn how to use MATLAB, the standard robotics programming environment and learn step by step how to use this mathematical tool to write functions, calculate vectors and produce visualizations. You will get hands on experience applying your knowledge to projects using various simulations in MATLAB.

## What you'll learn
- How to describe, analyze and think critically about fundamental problems in robotics, such as how to change the position or configuration of a robot
- The role of mathematics in describing robotic arms, mobile robots and other robotic platforms
- How to use the industry standard programming environment, MATLAB
